# Object Detection Web App

This project is a web-based object detection application that uses a fine-tuned YOLOv10 model to detect WBC, RBC, and Platelets in medical images. The application is built using **Gradio** and deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

---

##  Features
 Upload an image for object detection.  
 Displays detected objects with **bounding boxes** and **confidence scores**.  
 Shows a **Precision**, **Recall**, and **mAP** table for performance metrics.  
 Clean and user-friendly interface built using Gradio.

##  How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone github.com/Harshad712/Object-Detection-Web-App
cd object-detection-app
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download the Model File**
Ensure `best.pt` (your YOLOv10 model file) is in the project folder. If missing, download it and place it in the correct location.

4. **Run the Application**
```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Open the Web App**
Once the app starts , Gradio will generate a URL like:
```
Running on local URL: http://localhost:7860
